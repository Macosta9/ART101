					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We were tasked with experimenting with DOM manipulation.</p>
					
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Problems that we faced were getting the script output to show on the default 
						browser but after messing with it a while, I was able to figure it out I 
						wasn't able to figure out how to make every other text pop up on the left 
						of the screen even after trying a bunch of different things.</p>
						
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought that this assignmnet was really interesting to work on. It was a 
						little frustrating a first not being able to get the output to show up like 
						if it were a text conversation but I was still able to get the button 
						function to work which I was happy with.
