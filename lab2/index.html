        This is  all about me...
		<ol>
            My name is Mariana and my partner is Rylind. I am a third year and my partner is a second year. We both do theater. We both have had a great time in this class so far. We both don't have any expirnce with coding so we are a bit slow when it comes ot this, but we are excited that we are learning.
