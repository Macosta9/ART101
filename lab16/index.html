			<h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs (XKCD comic!)</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge of this lab was to experiment with JSON and API
						 while also taking screenshots to prove we'd done it.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled only slightly with the JavaScript but was able to figure it out.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I thought that this was a really interesting assinment to work on and I think 
						that I'm finally starting to get the hang of reading code and such and I am excited
						to see and work on what we decide to go over next!</p>
